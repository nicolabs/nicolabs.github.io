## Assets folder

This folder gathers asset files used in articles.

It keeps the same layout as the previous wesite located from http://www.nicobo.net/sites/default/files in order to ease migration of URLs, but the `pictures` subfolder may not be used for new assets.

The new layout is :

    3rdparty/       # local copy of remote pictures, some modified (e.g. resized)
        \_ logos/   # icons & logos of third party products
        \_ images/  # photos & pictures taken from external sources
    screenshots/    # screen captures or alike used to illustrate some articles
