This page lists some tools I've been using with success for while : they may fit your needs as well !

## Twidere

[Twidere](https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android) is definitely the only one, perfect, **Twitter** client for me (and I've been searching a lot).
It's open source. It handles every single feature I need.

I've been using it for years... And since it happens to be very good also at **Mastodon** I do continue to use it every day.
