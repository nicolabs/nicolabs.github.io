This page lists some tools I've been using with success for while : they may fit your needs as well !


## NextCloud

[NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/) (a fork of [OwnCloud](https://owncloud.org/)) is a very promising software that aims to bring usual cloud services to the home.

However, it's based on pluggable features that are not always stable. Here are the ones I'm using on a day-to-day basis :

- web interface to access my own files (however synchronization, backup and other features on files are not yet useable in my opinion)
- calendar (coupled with DAVDroid and any Android calendar it has all features Google Calendar has, except event import from/sharing to email)
- contacts (really excellent)
- news (use with a RSS/Atom reader on your mobile)
- bookmarks


## Twidere

[Twidere](https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android) is definitely the only one, perfect, **Twitter** Android client for me (and I've been searching a lot).
It's open source. It handles every single feature I need.

I've been using it for years... And since it happens to be very good also at **Mastodon** I do continue to use it every day.


## Wallabag

[Wallabag](https://wallabag.org) is an open source alternative to Pocket, Instapaper, ... to save articles from the web and read them later.
There are many integrations with web browsers and smartphones.
I've been adding and reading articles with wallabag for years : you don't need another tool !
