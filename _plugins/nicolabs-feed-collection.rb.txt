# FIXME This plugin does not work because I can't code in Ruby
# It should dynamically create the 'feed' collection,
# which would filter posts to include in the RSS/Atom feed.
# This would allow me to put all posts into the `_posts/` directory
# and simply filter on their `maturity` level or other parameter.
# Currently I have to put "live drafts" in a separate directory (_preposts)
