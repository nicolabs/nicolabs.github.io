What does it mean to "just synchronize my files" ?

At first it seems simple but behind the scene it has complex implications that cannot be solved by the machine alone.

# NextCloud / OwnCloud

Although they advertise *synchronization* features both on the server and on mobile applications, they actually lack one huge commonly requested feature : automatic file synchronization. The "synchronize" feature in the Android app actually just synchronizes a file or directory when clicked by the user : there is no automatic detection.
Plus, it's not (or very badly) documented so a standard user would probably give away very quickly.
