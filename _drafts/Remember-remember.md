**Rest in Peace** the following services that nobody would think they will vanish.

## ✝ Google Plus

Google Plus *was* Google's social network.

It was very promising, had more features than *microblogging* social networks like Twitter but less cluttered with plugins or apps than community-based networks like Facebook.
It was [leveraging on Google's network](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevecooper/2013/08/31/the-one-reason-every-blogger-should-use-google/) and tools to interconnect services, provide groups, timeline, sharing, ... Even if you are a casual user of social media, you probably have seen its logo within the "share" icons all over the web.

In 2018, Google closed the service. Maybe because of a security flaw or because it was just not in Google's top business goals anymore...

## ✝ Google Web Toolkit

![GWT old logo, refashioned](/assets/blog/3rdparty/logos/gwt.600x570.png){:height="92px"}

Google Web Toolkit (GWT) *was* a framework to build web applications that were compatible with most web browsers.

By the time, Javascript implementations in web browsers was a lot less compliant with common norms, making it very difficult for web developers to build "dynamic" web sites that were working in all major browsers.
GWT was building variants of a website working for the major market browsers from a unique Java source.

Many enterprises embraced this framework.

In 2012-2013, [Google actually retired support for it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Web_Toolkit) and released GWT as an [open-source-deal-with-it project](http://www.gwtproject.org/).

## ✝ Picasa

![Picasa logo](/assets/blog/3rdparty/logos/Picasa_Logo.svg){:height="92px"}

Picasa *was* a visionary photo manager software.

It was acquired in 2004 by Google from Lifescape.

It had desktop and web applications, even a Linux one.
It could tag photos, detect people, sort them by date, it had inline photo editing features, it provided a very user-friendly online album sharing platform and could work offline.
It was "just working" great.

I've been using it a long time.

In 2012 the desktop clients started to be retired.
In 2016 [the service was fully discontinued](https://support.google.com/picasa/answer/6383491?ref_topic=1689652&rd=2), in profit for the cloud-based *Google Photos* service.

## ✝ Tumblr

![Tumblr logo](/assets/blog/3rdparty/logos/Tumblr_Logos_2018.03.06_t Icon Blue.png " © Tumblr, Inc. - https://www.tumblr.com/logo"){:height="92px"}

Tumblr *was* a cool microblogging website mainly focused on original graphical content.

With it, it was very straightforward for an author to publish a simple and appealing blog with photos or pictures.
It also provided mobile apps that were quite enough to post from a phone.

Things started to get screwed when Yahoo acquired the Tumblr company : a relatively independent platform for personal, quirky or disruptive content had just been swallowed by [a giant data harvester](https://twitter.com/nic0b0/status/998676585959051266).
Tumblr's final sentence was imposed when Verizon (Oath) bought Yahoo at its turn, in 2017. Quickly, Verizon cluttered the product with very restrictive, unadapted rules and Tumblr became the worst user experience it could possibly be. Connecting to the platform as a regular user just became a devil of a job. [At the time of writing, a full-page GDPR warning](/assets/blog/screenshots/2020-04-04-tumblr-privacy-consent.png) still [regularly shows up when trying to access](https://talesfromweirdland.tumblr.com/post/189024998705/is-anyone-else-getting-these-way-too-often-so) a *tumblr* blog... just to allow displaying the logon screen !

There is nothing users can do against [a $1.1 billion check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr).

Epilog : Verizon finally left what's remaining of Tumblr to [Automattic (WordPress, Gravatar, ... has links with Yahoo)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automattic) in 2019 for [less that 1/50 the price it paid](https://www.axios.com/verizon-tumblr-wordpress-automattic-e6645edd-bc73-45c2-9380-9fe8ca34291f.html) in the first place...

## Conclusion : you know the safest place is at home, don't you ?

Use distributed systems.

Self-host your services.

*Computing resources do have a cost, if you don't pay with money you pay with your time or your data.*
