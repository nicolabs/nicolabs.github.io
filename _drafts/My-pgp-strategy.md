# My PGP strategy

## Balancing security and usability

- GPG key set :
  - root, most secure one
  - per device

## Make it useable

### On public directories

I've never been far in there because of one main reason : **spam**.

### Enter keybase.io

Same problems but more integrations available.
Decreased security but acceptable use : each one must be aware of the actual level of trust it brings.

Account created early, lost key (as usual because I've just not used it enough to make it in my long-term memory).
