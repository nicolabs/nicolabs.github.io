Very easy to install and run.

Just works.

Conflict files on a regular basis, but they've been always automatically handled up to now (just delete the .conflict files).
For this reason, git synchronization (or bundled mechanisms) might be a better choice for tools supporting it (e.g. passwordstore).

On Android it's sometimes stuck in "starting" state but apparently still synchronises ok. I suspect it's because of my custom configuration (either because of DnsChanger or ForceDoze)
