This blog is currently under construction : the current one can be found at [blog.nicolabs.net](http://blog.nicolabs.net).

It is built [with Jekyll on GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/). You can look at its source at [github.com/nicolabs/nicolabs.github.io](https://github.com/nicolabs/nicolabs.github.io) (but I bet you won't find it interesting for now...).

Its theme is based on nandomoreirame's ["simplest" theme](https://github.com/nandomoreirame/simplest). [Here's the license](https://github.com/nandomoreirame/simplest/blob/master/LICENSE).

The code for estimating and displaying the time to read an article comes from [atekihcan.github.io](http://atekihcan.github.io/blog/2014/reading-time-estimate-in-jekyll) and [github.com/renyuanz/leonids](https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids).
