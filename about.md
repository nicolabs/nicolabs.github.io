This blog talks about computer technology.
The old version can still be viewed at [blog.nicolabs.net](http://blog.nicolabs.net) but will be deleted one day, since [all new work is made here](/2016/Migrating-from-Drupal-to-Jekyll).

## Making of

It is built [with Jekyll on GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/). You can look at its source at [github.com/nicolabs/nicolabs.github.io](https://github.com/nicolabs/nicolabs.github.io) (but I bet you won't find it interesting for now...).

Its theme is based on *nandomoreirame's* ["simplest" theme](https://github.com/nandomoreirame/simplest).

The code for estimating and displaying the time to read an article comes from [atekihcan.github.io](http://atekihcan.github.io/blog/2014/reading-time-estimate-in-jekyll) and [github.com/renyuanz/leonids](https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids).

The main font 'Open Sans' is [Apache-licensed](/assets/fonts/opensans/Apache License.txt).

The *mastodon* widget is from [mastodon-timeline-widget](https://github.com/nicolabs/mastodon-timeline-widget).

The [tags page](/tags) has been possible thanks to [this blog article](https://codinfox.github.io/dev/2015/03/06/use-tags-and-categories-in-your-jekyll-based-github-pages/).
